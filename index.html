          <h1>Dominate your physique</h1>
          <p>I get it — every guy you see with the body you want is either doing the most or it seems like they have some genetic advantage along with the holy grail of insider fat loss secrets, allowing them to achieve a lean and ripped physique.</p>
          <p>If you’re not ready to sacrifice your entire life for the body of your dreams, I have good news: neither was I.</p>
          <p>That’s me to the right and there’s no way I could stomach staying lean year round if it meant I had to give up the other parts of my life.</p>
          <p>Now, this isn’t meant to say “I can eat whatever the fuck I want, when I want and the rest of you are shit outta luck.” What you need to understand is that the guys who are making it look effortless have simply tapped into the 20% of work that’s giving them 80% of their results.</p>
          <p>The only insider secret you’re actually missing is learning how to define the priorities that make up your 20%.</p>
          <p>So, you’re about 90 seconds away from loving me for showing you how to finally do this or hating me for showing you how much time you’ve already wasted.</p>

          <h3>Meet your abs.</h3>
          <p>No more gut. Are you with me? Whether or not you already have visible abs; our first priority is to cut any excess body-fat and prime your body for optimizing the muscle growth ahead.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="text col">
          <h3>Fill out your frame.</h3>
          <p>Now that you’re a clean slate we can start packing on new muscle from an optimal starting point. Broader shoulders, bigger arms and a filled-out chest. If I could, I’d even show you how to get taller.</p>

        <img src="/assets/ph-circle.svg">
        <div class="text col">
          <h3>Increase your horsepower.</h3>
          <p>Being all ‘show’ isn’t impressing anyone. It’s all about having that ‘show’ and that ‘go’. A muscular physique that can actually produce is worth its weight in gold. What good is a GM engine in the body of a Ferrari.</p>

          <h3>Redefine your reality.</h3>
          <p>Take back control of your life once and for all. When all of your values are finally aligned with how you look and feel you can experience what it means to be a fully congruent man.</p>
          <p>Take this step back for yourself and become a better man for the people who depend on you everyday. Become a resource and source of inspiration for the other guys around you.</p>
          <p>I call this part, “sweet, sweet, jacked victory.”</p>
