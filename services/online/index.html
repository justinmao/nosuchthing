        <p>The reality of personal training in its traditional form is one of inaccessibility. Coaching people in-person on a one-to-one basis will always be one of the most effective ways to teach anything but as long as the exchange of money for time is involved it will remain a luxury service. Where does this leave everyone else who needs help but faces time, location and financial constraints? App-based one-to-one coaching exists to fill this void and make a luxury in-person service accessible to everyone else in search of a solution for improving their body composition.</p>

          <h3>What is online coaching?</h3>

        </div>
        <div class="answer dropdown">
          <p>Online coaching is our private coaching service boxed and delivered as a cost-effective alternative to traditional in-person coaching. Our aim was to eliminate time and location constraints faced by our in-person clientele along with making the service accessible to a wider range of people who need our help.</p>
          <p>Traditionally, trainers have equipped their clients with poorly designed spreadsheets and essentially an unboxed, scattered version of their in-person service to hold clients over during breaks between appointments. What we’ve done is eliminated the spreadsheets and given you a single hub for everything related to your nutrition and training along with making access to your measured progress as easy as checking Instagram to ensure you’re getting the results you’ve signed up for.</p>
          <p>Your entire training and nutrition calendar is programmed out for you and monitored on a daily basis. Programs are cycled in 4 to 6 week phases – depending on your goals and skill level. Our platform also plays well with some of your favourites such as MyFitnessPal and FitBit.</p>
          <p>If you like the sounds of this and think that it’s a possible solution for you but you’re located in Toronto and feel that a minimal amount of in-person coaching each month will also serve you well, click below:</p>

        </div>
        <div class="answer dropdown">
          <p>App-based is what you’d imagine it is – our service bundled up and delivered through an app on your smartphone. Every asset related to delivering our coaching and proving it’s working can be found in this app – your program, meal plans, progress pictures, body stats, lifting stats and communicating with your coach – all at the swipe of a finger.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="answer dropdown">
          <p>With online coaching you receive the same individualized intake and programming as every one of our in-person clients. The app is just a channel from which to deliver that same experience you’d expect with an in-person coach. You gain the same access to our guides and video content as an in-person client along with additional content to ensure you’re able to navigate every element of your training and eating safely and effectively without the direct supervision you’d find in-person.</p>
          <p>Most importantly – you stand to enjoy the same results as our in-person clientele.</p>

          <h3>How is this service different from in-person coaching?</h3>
          <img src="/assets/down-arrow-blue.svg" class="arrow faq-arrow">
        </div>
        <div class="answer dropdown">
          <p>An obvious difference – you don’t meet with a living breathing individual multiple times each week. You have the ability to free yourself of the location – be it continent, country, or even living in a different part of the city than we service. You are also able to free yourself of your trainers availability or lack thereof.</p>
          <p>Due to the fact that you do not meet with someone on a weekly basis we have added measures in place to ensure adherence and support for our online clients. Scheduled weekly support means we set aside and schedule a time every week to check-in and address any issues you’ve faced in the previous week. Each week you’ll receive and return a feedback form so that we have clearly outlined talking points and can address all of your concerns properly. This along with daily reminders and notifications from our team is an added level of communication that only our online clients receive.</p>

        <div class="answer dropdown">
          <p>Based on your intake we can establish the appropriate starting point for you in terms of movement and progression model. We have solutions for beginner, intermediate, and advanced trainees. You will receive an individualized program based on your skill level, possible limitations and training history. Your program will be updated every 4 to 6 weeks depending on your level of experience.</p>

        <div class="answer dropdown">
          <p>Based on your intake we can also establish the least disruptive approach to dieting that we believe will satisfy your goals, lifestyle, preferred style of diet, dietary restrictions, intolerances and allergies. Your nutrition program can take the form of flexible guidelines, specified calories and macronutrients, or specific meal plans.

        </div>
        <div class="answer dropdown">
          <p>Due to the fact that you’ll be working independently we need to set aside a time for you and your coach to formally meet over video each and every week. Each week leading up to your call you will receive a check-in form that we will use to guide our call and make sure that all points of concern are addressed properly.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="answer dropdown">
          <p>A much more intuitive delivery as you train independently. What this means for you is that you won’t have to manage multiple files spanning your training and nutrition programs. When you’re in the gym you’ll be able to follow along with your program easily and focus on your training instead of bouncing between multiple files and apps on your smartphone.</p>
          <p>We also make your progress easily accessible. Whether that means progress photos, your lifting stats or your body stats, every point that’s relevant to your goals is in one place for you to reference at any time. With nothing to hide, our coaches are able to quickly squash any potential obstruction to your goals.</p>
          <p>Having your entire program scheduled out in one calendar shared with your coach allows us to do a much more effective job at helping you adhere to your program as you work independently.</p>
          <p>Our platform also plays well with MyFitnessPal and FitBit which allows you to further consolidate your training and nutrition into one place.</p>

          <p>Part of being a NOSUCHTHING training client means you get access to a large pool of video and ebook resources we’ve designed specifically for our clients to have a more intuitive experience with our services. We are constantly expanding on this collection of guides to address every possible question, concern and element of our service.</p>
          <p>This means you’ll have the resources to reference in-between your weekly check-in in the event that you have an urgent concern and the material to help you long after you exit our service.</p>
          <p>If the piece of content you need doesn’t already exist, this presents the perfect opportunity for us to create it for you and other clients facing the same challenges as you.</p>
          <p>As NOSUCHTHING® expands into selling information products we will also provide these paid products as a complimentary bonus to our existing clientele.</p>
          <p>The breadth of content available to help you have the best possible experience while working with us and for use well-beyond working with us is truly unique in the world of personal training both in-person and online.</p>
