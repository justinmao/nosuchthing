      <h1>Looking like a gym guy doesn’t have to mean living like one.</h1>
      <p>I’m you, but years ahead. I didn’t want to play around with trial and error either, but at the time what other choice did I have? I knew there had to be methods that would give me an obvious return on my efforts, I just had to figure them out for myself. So I did. I learned how to develop and include key lifestyle and mindset habits into my day to finally put me in total control of my physique. At this point I’ve mastered this and built my entire life around it with little disruption to the other parts of my life.</p>
      <p>I’m going to show you how to redistribute your energy, efforts and priorities so that getting the results you need won’t mean trying harder but rather, just trying in the right direction. You’ll need someone who’s been there, lives there and has shown countless others how to get there and stay there. Welcome to the team.</p>

            <p>With in-person guidance multiple times per week you can expect to acquire the skills of lifting and dieting at an accelerated pace because you’ll have me right there with you every step of the way. The reality of training is that some lessons are more effectively delivered and communicated in person.</p>
